# Radon Transform Demo - Sparse and Limited Angle CT Reconstruction
Author: [Ali Almuallem](https://www.linkedin.com/in/almuallem). 5 January 2022.

A simple tutorial of the infamous [Radon Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_transform) for computed tomography (CT) applications with sparse and limited angle scenarios.

> Note: this is a personal effort tutorial that is prone to errors and mistakes. As I learn more and have time, I will update this notebook with more cool materials and corrections of any potential mistakes.
